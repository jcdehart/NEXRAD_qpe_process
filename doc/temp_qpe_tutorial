wget -r https://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/SRTM3/North_America/

That actually downloads the entire globe into a subdirectory:

  dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/SRTM3/

plus some other data you don't need. But this is the quickest way to do the download.

And then you can move SRTM3 to where-ever it is needed. And you need to unzip the files.
 
The Eurasia subdirectory probably has the Taiwan files

1) Downloading GFS data
https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/global-forcast-system-gfs
Select the HAS option for the 0.5º domain (the first GFS analysis available)
On the next page, select all available UTC cycles (00, 06, 12, 18) and the start and end dates
Select the batch option and enter your email address
You'll receive an email when the data is ready; use the order download guide to download it to maui (I usually use option 2.2 (wget) to download the files, just modify the HAS01***** portion to whatever the emails says your order number is)

2) Set up directories

I usually put the files in a folder called gfs within the project directory. (this is with the old Radx programs, yours would look similar except partrain == rate)
Extract the grb2 files using this command in terminal: for f in *.tar; do tar xf "$f"; done
Delete the tar files: rm -f *.tar (**be careful with rm -f as it deletes everything without asking**)

3) Set up parameter files to convert model data to soundings
Get parameter files for Grib2toMdv and Mdv2SoundingSpdb (you can rsync the two that are in my directory /bell-scratch/jcdehart/forJaime/params)
Edit grid info (set up to be a 20ºx20º box around radar location) in Grib2toMdv.gfs.co line 792: 
out_grid_info = {
    nx = 200,
    ny = 200,
    minx = -115, **** change to radar lon-10º
    miny = 30 , **** change to radar lat-10º
    dx = 0.1,
    dy = 0.1
};

Step 3b) Edit Mdv2SoundingSpdb.ruc
line 284: station_locations
Replace the name, lat, lon, altitude with the relevant details from the Taiwan radar. If you'll be using more than 1 radar, we can deal with that later.
